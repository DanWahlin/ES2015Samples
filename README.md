# ES6/ES2015 Samples
==========

A set of ECMAScript 2015 (also called ES6) examples as well as a Gulp file that converts them to ES5 using Babel.

## To run the samples:

1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org (latest LTS version is recommended)

1. Run `npm install` at the root of the project in a command window

1. Install the `gulp` package globally:

    `npm install -g gulp`

1. Run `gulp` (from the root of the project) in the command window to transpile ES6/ES2015 code to ES5 (leave the window open since it watches for file changes)

1. Open another console window and run `npm start` to launch the browser
